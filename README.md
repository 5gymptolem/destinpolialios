The goal of the team is to build a mobile application that will recognize monuments of the city of Ptolemaida using artificial intelligence and then inform the user with multimodal data about the monument they have identified.
We are currently in the machine learning phase.
Students appropriately photograph the monuments they will participate in so that the machine learning model can then be appropriately fed.
